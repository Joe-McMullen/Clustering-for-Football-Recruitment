# Clustering-for-Football-Recruitment
 
The aim of this project was to enable recruitment teams to identify similar players to any given player.
This will save scouts time watching unsuitable players and allow a global player search


Uses kmeans clustering to group similar players based on their football manager stats
Uses linear regression to estimate player value based on transfermarkt data


player value data set obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores
fm database webscraped using code

Webscraped data included so does not need to be rerun

Files should be run in the order:
- EDA_and_linear_regression.ipynb
- Clustering.ipynb

Capstone project which marks the end of my 3 month intensive data-specialism course with Digital Futures
